An awesome IRC bot that will make your IRC channel _better_.

Databases not included to ensure the bot has his own special charm for every channel's culture.

Check the sources for what it does and what you might need to start it.
I realize it's a lot to ask, but you must work to get to know this guy ;)


PS: your computer can probably get hacked through this bot :)


## Charm module and other configs

Files ending in `.db` are the charm secret sauce. Configure responsibly.

.config - IRC & other settings. "key value", keys: folder,name,serv,chan,login,owner
<folder from .config>/
    msgs.db - used for @msgs, can be empty
    events.db - used for @event, can be empty (also doesn't really work)
    lasttweets.db - used by the twitter part, will be autopopulated if t is setup
    trusted.db - list of names that can maybe do a bit more than the unknowns.
    awww.db - words that might appear in sites with cute pictues and such. 
    noawww.db - words that negate the cuteness (e.g. dolphin rape caves)
    meh.db - words that might appear in sentences you'd say "meh." to.
    nomeh.db - some things just are awesome... negate the mehness.
    twss.db - some snippets that would make one say "that's what she said".
    bots.db - the names of other known bots on the channel.
    dontmention.db - don't mention these names, because it might annoy them.
    girls.db - to phrase certain replies correctly. Not trying to be creepy :)
