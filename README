Databases not included as that would take the magic out of him.
Also, your computer can probably get hacked through this bot :)

Check the sources for extra files you might need and figure it out.
.haibot - settings... "key value" store
tasks.db - used for @msgs, can be empty
events.db - used for @event, can be empty
awww.db - words that might appear in sites with cute pictues. 
noawww.db - words that negate the cuteness (it used to think tentacle rape was cute)
meh.db - words that might appear in sentences you'd say "meh." to.
nomeh.db - some things just are awesome... negate the mehness.
twss.db - some snippets that would make one say "that's what she said".
badexts.db - just some ".ext" stuff you don't want to even consider downloading.
bros.db - names of other bots or actual bros on channel.
dontmention.db - don't mention these names, because it annoys them or smth.
stoplist.db - stopwords for some text processing

Some libs that are used:
boilerpipe - the article extractor library
langdetect - not used yet, but will be
WordNet - Prolog version... easier to parse than the actual one :)
