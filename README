Databases not included as that would take the magic out of him.
Also, your computer can probably get hacked through this bot :)

Check the sources for extra files you might need and figure it out.
.haibot - settings... "key value"
tasks.db - used for @msgs, can be empty
awww.db - words that might appear in sites with cute pictues.
meh.db - words that might appear in sentences you'd say "meh." to.
twss.db - some snippets that would make one say "that's what she said".
badexts.db - just some ".ext" stuff you don't want to download...
block.db - don't mention these names, because it annoys them or smth.
