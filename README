----------------------------------------------
 tehbots - A bunch of simple trollish bots... 
----------------------------------------------

Databases not included as that would take the magic out of the bots.

Tehbots are:
teh_bot - should be smartest... actually just randomly says stuff.
rym_bot - a very crude "roses are red" bot... everyone hates him.
meh_bot - says "meh." when it thinks it's apropriate.

Check the sources for extra files you might need and figure it out.
wordbag.db - a mildly cleaned-up channel log, so major repetition there.
meh_bot.db - words that might appear in sentences you'd say "meh." to.
  .channel - name of channel you wish to troll.
