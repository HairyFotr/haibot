A sort-of cool IRC bot.
Databases not included as that would take the magic out of him.
Check the sources for what it does and what you might need to start it.
I realize it's a lot to ask, but you must work to get to know this guy ;)
Also, your computer can probably get hacked through this bot :)

Last time I updated this README the extra files were:
.config - IRC & other settings... "key value", keys are: folder,name,serv,chan,owner
<folder from .config>/
    msgs.db - used for @msgs, can be empty
    events.db - used for @event, can be empty (also doesn't really work)
    lasttweets.db - used by the twitter part, will be autopopulated if t is setup
    trusted.db - list of names that can maybe do a bit more than the unknowns.
    awww.db - words that might appear in sites with cute pictues and such. 
    noawww.db - words that negate the cuteness (e.g. dolphin rape caves)
    meh.db - words that might appear in sentences you'd say "meh." to.
    nomeh.db - some things just are awesome... negate the mehness.
    twss.db - some snippets that would make one say "that's what she said".
    bots.db - the names of other known bots on the channel.
    dontmention.db - don't mention these names, because it might annoy them.
    girls.db - to phrase certain replies correctly. Not trying to be creepy :)
utils/
    badexts.db - some extensions you don't want to even consider downloading
    stoplist.db - stopwords for some text processing
    weights - some weights for wordnet tables
    

And the used libs were:
    pircbot - Java IRC Bot -- autodownloaded
    boilerpipe - the article extractor library -- autodownloaded
    WordNet - lexical db for English (prolog version) -- autodownloaded
    bitlyj - A DSL for Bitly-powered Url Shortening Services -- autodownloaded
    t - twitter CLI client -- you need to set it up manually
    fbcmd - facebook CLI client 2.0 -- also manually.
