Databases not included as that would take the magic out of him.
Also, your computer can probably get hacked through this bot :)
Also, ignore other bots - too lazy to properly get rid of them.

Check the sources for extra files you might need and figure it out.
.haibot - settings... "key value"
tasks.db - used for @msgs, can be empty
awww.db - words that might appear in sites with cute pictues. 
noawww.db - words that negate the cuteness (it used to think tentacle rape was cute)
meh.db - words that might appear in sentences you'd say "meh." to.
nomeh.db - some things just are awesome... negate the mehness.
twss.db - some snippets that would make one say "that's what she said".
badexts.db - just some ".ext" stuff you don't want to download...
block.db - don't mention these names, because it annoys them or smth.

Some libs that are used:
boilerpipe - the article extractor library
langdetect - not used yet, but will be
Wordnet - Prolog version... easier to parse than the actual one :)
